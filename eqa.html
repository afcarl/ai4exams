As artificial intelligence has matured as a field, many researchers have attempted to define what it means for a machine to be intelligent, and how to measure our progress in creating intelligent machines.  While the Turing test has emerged as the most famous and most often referenced test of artificial intelligence outs

In recent years, attention has also focused on the use of exams, quizzes, as word games as IBM's Watson system outperformed human competitors on Jeopardy!

The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Alan Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses.

We've created this website as community resource for researchers interested in machine intelligence, particularly in systems developed for or evaluated in an exam QA setting.  We define exam QA as a machine reading task in which the system is provided a set of texts (sometimes with visual aids) and a corresponding set of questions.  The system is successful if it can process the text and provide the correct answers to the questions.  These questions can be multiple choice, in which a set of answer candidates in given, or short answer, where they are not.
